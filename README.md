***Inspirals by Radix (Rob Dixon)***

This is a single-generation version of Inspirals for testing.

Each spiral is generated from a token hash like the one injected by ArtBlocks at minting time.

Each spiral uses a specific shape and symmetry to create a repeatable tiled texture (think Escher). Based on those settings, there are from 2 to 6 distortion parameters that can be used to alter and deform the tiled shape in various ways. The sliders on the page let you manipulate the distortion parameters. Or just use the D and F keys to animate and enjoy!

Keyboard features:

    D = Distort the pattern. Hit again to stop.
    F = Fly through the spiral. Hit again to stop.
    U = Hide or show the UI to change distortion values.
    S = Save the current spiral as a JPG file.
    C = Color shift the hue.
    T = Toggle single/double spiral mode.
